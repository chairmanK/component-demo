# component-demo

This example application demonstrates usage of
[component](https://stuartsierra/component).

## Usage

To run the application:

    lein trampoline run

To run tests:

    lein test

To start a REPL:

    lein repl

The REPL will start in a `user` namespace that is prepopulated for a
["reloaded"](https://github.com/stuartsierra/reloaded) workflow. In the REPL,
call

    user=> (go)

to reload source and restart the application.
